## introduction:
 This repository was created to develop the main projects from the course "Sistemas Digitais 2", ministered in the first semester of 2023 by the Computer Engineering Department of the University of São Paulo.
 
 The course is taken in groups of 3, in which our members are: @CarlosEngler @ @. The objective of the course is to learn and explore the concepts surrounding the operation of modern processors (such as a RISC-V) and develop them using the Verilog HDL.

 ## Current Projects

 The first project we worked on was making a Karatsuba multiplier.
 The current project we are developing throughout the classes is the main architecture of a RISC-V processor.
 The future implementations we make in each class will be made in branches.
